# SignalFx Sink

This sink sends Veneur metrics to [SignalFx](https://signalfx.com/).

# Status

**This sink is experimental**. This sink does not yet provide all of the functionality that SignalFx allows. Some of Veneur's primitives still need to be mapped to those of SignalFx.

# TODO

* Does not handle events correctly yet, only copies timestamp, title and tags
